            <p>Javascript (JS) is a lightweight language used mainly for the logic area of web development,
                alongside
                its brother Typescript (TS). They are very similar with each other: while JS is used for
                interactive web pages, TS is strongly typed and can check errors when assigning types.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some frameworks that use either JS or TS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Angular</li>
                <li>Meteor</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But, what are the differences between JS and TS? Here we have the most important ones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>TS is a 'superset' of JS, which means it understands all JS features and include new ones.
                </li>
                <li>TS needs to be compiled to JS before it can run.</li>
                <li>TS is strongly typed, this means you must exlpicitly declare the datatypes when creating a
                    variable,
                    and they can not be changed. On the other hand, JS is dynamically typed: you dont need to
                    declare the
                    datatype and it can be changed anywhere.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Do not confuse Javascript with Java: they are two completely different languages! While both of them are
                registered trademarks of Oracle in the US, their sintaxis, use and semantics are very different.</p>
            <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript" target="_blank">Read Javascript
                    documentation.</a> Reading a bit is always good!</p>

            <p>Although JS is called 'begginer friendly' by some people, things get harder the more you dive into it. To
                make it simple, we will print a single line:</p>
            <code>
                console.log("Hello World!")
            </code>
            <p>You can try coping and pasting it in an online JS compiler.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Variables are used to contain a value in an application.</p>
            <p>You can start variables with letters, an underscore (_), a dollar sign ($), numbers (0-9), and because JS
                is case-sensitive, we can go from "A" to "Z" and from "a" to "z". Those are a lot of possible variables!
            </p>
            <p>There are 3 ways of declaring a variable:</p>
            <p>The first one is by using the 'var' keyword. It declares the variably both globally and locally:</p>
            <code>var x = 42;</code>
            <p>The second way is by the 'let' keyword. It declares the variable as
                '<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-es2015-block-scoping/" target="_blank">block
                    scoped</a>':</p>
            <code>let x = 12;</code>
            <p>And lastly, we can just asign a varibale:</p>
            <code>x = 42;</code>
            <p>Note that this last way of declaring a variable will give us a JS error and we should not use it.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Datatypes">
            <header>Datatypes</header>
            <p>A datatype gives us details about the variable we are using. It is universally important in all
                programming
                languages, and JS features 8 different datatypes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>String ("Hello world!")</li>
                <li>Number (from 9 to 3.14159)</li>
                <li>Bigint (a very large number)</li>
                <li>Boolean (true or false)</li>
                <li>Undefined (literally undefined)</li>
                <li>Null (different from null or NULL)</li>
                <li>Symbol (guaranteed to be unique)</li>
                <li>Object (it can be an objet, an array or a date)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some characteristics of JS makes datatypes interact in different ways.</p>
            <p>For example, when adding a number to a string, JS will work with the number as a string:</p>
            <code>let x = 16 + "keybards"<br>
                console.log(x)
            </code>
            <p>If we compile this, we will get the result <code>16car</code>.</p>

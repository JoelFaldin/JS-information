            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Javascript (JS) is a lightweight language used mainly for the logic area of web development, alongside
                its brother Typescript (TS). They are very similar with each other: while javascript is used for
                interactive web pages, typescript is strongly typed and can check errors when assigning types.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some frameworks that use either JS or TS:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React</li>
                <li>Angular</li>
                <li>Meteor</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Javascript</h1>
            <p>Do not confuse Javascript with Java: they are two completely different languages! While both of them are
                registered trademarks of Oracle in the US, their sintaxis, use and semantics are very different.</p>

                    documentation.</a> Reading a bit is always good!</p>

            <h1>How to print things</h1>
            <p>Although JS is called 'begginer friendly' by some people, things get harder the more you dive into it. To
                make it simple, we will print a single line:</p>
            <pre>console.log("Hello World!")
        </pre>
            <p>You can try coping and pasting it in a online JS compiler.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="var">
            <h1>Variables</h1>
            <p>Variables are used to contain a value in an application.</p>
            <p>You can start variables with letters, an underscore (_), a dollar sign ($), numbers (0-9), and because JS
                is case-sensitive, we can go from "A" to "Z" and from "a" to "z". Those are a lot of possible variables!
            </p>
            <pre>There are 3 ways of declaring a variable:
